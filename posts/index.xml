      <description>Question on Academia Stack Exchange Description In the writing of scientific papers, there are basically two chapters: Introduction and Related Work. This is a common issue, that many people get confused how to organize introduction and related work chapters. Because both are related to the literature review.
This post is my personal view on the issue. If you have any suggestions on this post, please leave comments below.
What is Introduction and Related Work? This document, How to Write a Scientific Paper, is based on resources from the Universit√© de Rennes 1 and Western Kentucky University.</description>

      <description>Weights &amp;amp; Biases: Weights &amp;amp; Biases makes it easy to track your experiments, manage &amp;amp; version your data, and collaborate with your team so you can focus on building the best models.
Accelerate: Accelerate is a library that enables the same PyTorch code to be run across any distributed configuration by adding just four lines of code! In short, training and inference at scale made simple, efficient and adaptable.</description>
