      <description>This paper is published in CVPR 2022. Overview Problem Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem, and most existing mothods are ineffective because they produce a deterministic estimate of the clean image. Point-estimators that directly minimize a distortion loss suffers from the problem of &amp;ldquo;regression to the mean&amp;rdquo;. Solution Present a new framework for blind deblurring based on conditional diffusion models. Porducing a diverse set of plausible reconstructions for a given input. Results A significant improvement in perceptual qulity over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmarks.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in the Paper Reading series. In this series I will continue to update some personal study notes on reading papers. This post will introduce the basic work of diffusion probabilistic models (DPM), including the derivation of formulas and simple code verification. The content is mainly from [1,2]. If you have any suggestions on this post or would like to communicate with me, please leave comments below.

      <description>Question on Academia Stack ExchangeDescription In the writing of scientific papers, there are basically two chapters: Introduction and Related Work. This is a common issue, that many people get confused how to organize introduction and related work chapters. Because both are related to the literature review.
This post is my personal view on the issue. If you have any suggestions on this post, please leave comments below.
What is Introduction and Related Work? This document, How to Write a Scientific Paper, is based on resources from the Universit√© de Rennes 1 and Western Kentucky University.</description>
